#Projectwork day 1. Movement

Today I finally started doing some work on my 2d fighting game project. 

As I didn't realise the big differences between 2d and 3d I struggled a lot as I only had my youtube videos to learn from. 

Since I had to do all the background and actually implement a player character as a sprite if took me quite some time to actually get a fitting background and make all the frames for my scissors character. 
Which will be the initial character for starrt up.

Furthermore, I struggled a lot with the camera as the videos I saw didn't make sense with my work and I became very furious as I couldn't see my character 

As I was mainly focused on doing simple movement today I only added this code below. But had to do a lot of settings and animation videos.

```
void Update()
    {
        animator.SetFloat("Horizontal", Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"));

        Vector3 horizontal = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0.0f, 0.0f);

        transform.position = transform.position + horizontal * Time.deltaTime;
    }
```

However, even though it looks quite goofy my character could walk back and forth on screen with right and left click.

Now that I have a better view on how 2d differs from 3d and how animations should be used with the animator components I would like to do some hitting and blocking animation and the Healthbar UI tomorrow.
